After exam, I let out a sigh of relief knowing that the torture is finally over. In school, we had post exam activities arrange by the school. 
For Monday, the school arranged a Math trail for us. We were put into groups of four to solve different types of math problems. For the first problems, my group did not meet the teachers expectations so we were feeling quite negative. 
For the second quiz, although my group did not complete the problems, we were ble to complete more than the first problem. For the third problem, my group managed to complete it which made us very proud.
For the fourth and final problem, my group did not really understand what the teacher meant by distractions so we solved every puzzle we entered to. Thanks to the guidance of the teacher, we did not waste that much time solving the unneccsary problems. Out of the six questions, my group was only able to solve five of them which was a pity.
After the math trail, it was time for our recess and i had to sadly say goodbye.
After recess , it was time for a movie. The movie was very touching and had a lot of meaning in it.
To summarise that day, it was very fun and relaxing. Although i had to revise back math, it was not as boring as i thought it would be. The movie was also very meaningful and the music was a blessing to my ears.
